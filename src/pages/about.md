Hello! I'm Gabriel Carvalho,
a back-end developer with experience in building and automating complex processes. I specialize in Python and typescript, but my enthusiasm for DevOps has driven me to create my own homelab to host applications.

I work at [delfia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/delfia/life/diaadiadacuradoria/) as a observability engineer, focusing on open-telemetry and grafana labs.

As you can see, I'm a open-telemetry nerd (grafana and hyperDX) and cloudflare workers enthusiast (for real, this thing is the future of serveless computation)

## Tech Stack

Here are the main technologies used in my development stack:

- Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, pydantic, aioredis, odmantic)
- Typescript (Hono, Drizzle, zod, better-auth)
- Cloudflare DNS (cert-manager and proxy) and workers compute platform (d1, queues, workflows, r2, durable objects)
- Cloud services (homelab, on-promisse, hetzner, magalu cloud and AWS)
- Containerization with Docker (portainer) and Kubernetes (k3s, rancher)
- I love gitops, gitops repo strategy, and with portainer and argoCD
- PostgreSQL, clickhouse, d1 and r2 for data management
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Virtualization using Proxmox
- Unix/Linux environments
